# mammal-sleep-behavior-analysis
In this project, I analyzed a dataset called Msleep in short, which is
Mammal Sleep Behavior Data Set. In this data set, sleep patterns are given with
body weight, brain weight, conservation type, genus, order and -vore type that can
be said that has effects on the sleeping patterns of the mammals. Sleep patterns in
between -vores and other features are analyzed to understand if there exist a pattern
at all. These traits then analyzed to find a statistical significance of sleep pattern
with different statistical metrics and perspectives, such as linearity testing, mean
significance by t-test, correlation analysis, linear regression and variance analysis.
Results indicate that there are some significant dependencies between body~brain
weight to sleep, furthermore domestication has an effect, but -vore effect is not
significant
